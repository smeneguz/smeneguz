# Silvio Meneguzzo — Blockchain Researcher & Builder

I design, build, and evaluate systems at the intersection of blockchain, cryptography, and cyber-physical infrastructures.
Currently: DAO sustainability metrics, digital twins <-> DLT, and ZK-powered data integrity.

## What I am focused on
- DAO longevity and governance: KPIs, non-parametric analysis, reproducible pipelines
- Energy data spaces: Ocean Protocol + IDSA, GAIA-X-aligned data exchange
- ZK and applied cryptography: proofs-in-practice; Merkle/Mountain trees for auditability

## Selected work
- SwapFee DApp — pay gas with custom tokens (IOTA Sponsored and Programmable Transactions), 3rd place at IOTA Hackathon
- EU-DREAM — DLT anchoring in digital-twin architectures for consumer-centric energy
- DAO Sustainability — framework + dataset + code for governance robustness
- Monolith SDK — interactive bubbles for Rocket.Chat, dev APIs and UX components
- DataCellar — Ocean Protocol + IDSA connectors for ERC721/20 data assets

> See pinned repos below for code and docs.

## Tech I use
Go, Rust, TypeScript, Solidity, Python
Hyperledger Fabric, Cosmos SDK, Ocean Protocol
Docker, GitHub Actions
ZKP, MPC, FHE (learning-by-doing)
LaTeX

## Now
- Visiting researcher at Brunel University London — mathematical models for DAO longevity
- Building a DAO Data Extractor + analysis toolkit across multiple chains

If you work on DAOs, ZK, or energy data spaces, I am happy to collaborate.
